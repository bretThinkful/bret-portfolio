                <h3>About Me</h3>

                <p> I am coming from being a retail manager. I spend my spare time taking care of my daughter and studying. I live in Loveland, Colorado and I enjoy hiking and being outside. </p>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp to better develop my skills. Before <b>Thinkful</b> I took multiple courses online to try and hone my skills. I ended up deciding to take a more in-depth route learning not only the language
                    side but the interviewing and job placement aspect. </p>
                <p>As a student at Thinkful, I'm confident I can achieve my goals to become a better developer. Being motivated I have no doubt after I take this "bootcamp" I will be job ready. </p>
                <p>During my time at "Thinkful" I plan on collaborating with the Thinkful team as well as my fellow classmates to develop stronger understanding of each topic studied.</p>
